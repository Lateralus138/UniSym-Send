## Features <a name="features"></a>

- Send Unicode symbols.
- Copy hexadcimal values or unicode symbols to the clipboard.
- Cross-reference hexadcimal values or unicode symbols.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### This program is a portable executable that runs in the System Tray. 

- Run the program and it will bring up the display:

![UI](./images/ui.png)

- Enter either a hexadcimal value or the Unicode symbol in the corresponding control:

![UI Where](./images/ui_where.png)

- To send the ui to the System Tray send hotkeys or a button:

![UI Tray](./images/ui_tray.png)

  - Hotkeys
    - Esc
    - Alt+t
  - Button
    - System Tray

- To show the window either right click on the 'UniSym Send' icon in the System Tray and click 'Show UniSym Send' or use a hotkey:

![UI Tray 2](./images/ui_tray2.png)

  - Hotkey
    - Win+Shift+u

## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

I work and play with Unicode a lot and wanted a easy way to do so.

There is another tool like this (also written in AutoHotkey) and it works just fine, but all it can do is send.

## Project/Downloads <a name="downloads"></a>

### This program can be ran in 2 ways:


- Compiled executable - portable/single file, no dependencies.
